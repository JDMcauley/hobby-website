# hobby-website
A website built to host a gallery for each one of my cats.

It contains a home page, index.html, the two gallery pages, salem.html and wednesday.html and a contact page, which contains an email form.

Tailwind CDN was used for styling.

All pages are somewhat responsive and display properly on screens roughly 300px and above.
